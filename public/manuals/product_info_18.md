## Reviews
1) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** This ceiling fan controller has been a game changer in our home. The installation was straightforward even for a DIY novice like me - the included wiring diagrams were extremely clear. Now our five ceiling fans are part of our smart home ecosystem, responding to temperature changes automatically. I've noticed real energy savings since installation as the fans adjust their speed based on actual needs rather than running constantly. The breeze mode is particularly nice in the bedroom - much more natural feeling than a constant speed.

2) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** Overall a solid product that delivers on its promises. Installation was fairly easy in most rooms, though I did have some challenges with an older fan that had non-standard wiring (ended up calling an electrician for that one). The integration with my Meowtica thermostat works flawlessly - when the AC kicks on, the fans automatically adjust to help distribute the cool air. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the wall switch buttons could be more responsive, sometimes requiring an extra firm press.

3) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** As someone with mobility issues, being able to control my ceiling fans by voice or phone app has been liberating. No more struggling with pull chains or wall switches across the room. The scheduling feature is perfect - I have the fans programmed to come on 30 minutes before I typically arrive home so the house feels comfortable immediately. The energy monitoring feature showed me that running the fans smartly actually costs very little compared to the comfort benefit they provide.

4) **Rating:** 5
   **Review:** The temperature automation is worth the price alone. I installed temperature sensors in various rooms, and the fans automatically adjust based on actual conditions in each space. Our two-story house used to have significant temperature differences between floors, but with these smart fans working with our HVAC system, the temperature stays much more consistent throughout the home. Installation was straightforward, and the app interface is intuitive and responsive.

5) **Rating:** 4
   **Review:** This is my third brand of smart fan controller, and it's definitely the most reliable. The others had constant connectivity issues, but this one has maintained a solid connection for months. The light dimming works perfectly with my LED bulbs (which wasn't the case with previous controllers). My only complaint is that the in-canopy version is a tight fit in some of my older fans, requiring some creative wire management. That said, the functionality and reliability make it worth the effort.

## FAQ
1) Will this controller work with my specific ceiling fan model?
   The WhiskerSense Ceiling Fan Controller works with most standard AC-powered ceiling fans with separate fan and light controls. Compatible fans include those with pull chains, standard wall switches, or basic remotes (though the controller will replace these control methods). It is NOT compatible with: DC motor fans, fans with proprietary control systems that cannot be bypassed, fans without a neutral wire, or fans that exceed the power ratings (1.5A/180W for the fan motor, 300W for lights). If you're unsure about compatibility, please contact our support team with your fan make and model for verification.

2) Do I need an electrician to install this controller?
   While many homeowners with basic electrical knowledge can successfully install the WhiskerSense Controller, we recommend professional installation if you are unfamiliar with household electrical wiring. The installation requires working with live electrical circuits and proper wiring connections. The wall switch installation is typically simpler than the in-canopy option. Whatever method you choose, always follow electrical safety protocols: turn off power at the circuit breaker (not just the switch), verify power is off with a voltage tester, and ensure all connections are secure and properly insulated.

3) Can I control fan speed and light brightness independently?
   Yes, the WhiskerSense Controller allows completely independent control of fan speed and light brightness. You can adjust the fan to any of 3-4 speeds (depending on your fan model) while setting the light to any brightness level between 1-100% (for dimmable bulbs). These controls work separately via the app, voice commands, or physical wall switch (if installed as a wall switch). You can also create automations that adjust only the fan or only the light based on different triggers such as time of day, temperature, or occupancy.

4) How does the temperature-based automation work?
   Temperature-based automation requires at least one Meowtica temperature sensor or compatible smart thermostat in the same room as the fan. Once connected, you can set temperature thresholds that trigger different fan speeds. For example, you might configure the fan to turn on low when the room reaches 74°F, switch to medium at 76°F, and high at 78°F. The system can be set to automatically reduce speed or turn off when the temperature falls below your specified thresholds. This creates an intelligent cooling system that works with your air conditioning to improve efficiency and comfort.

5) Can I still use my existing wall switch or remote after installation?
   It depends on your installation method. With the in-canopy installation, your existing wall switch must remain in the "on" position to provide power to the controller (you can replace it with a blank cover plate or smart button). Any existing remote will be replaced by the WhiskerSense control system. With the wall switch installation, the WhiskerSense Controller physically replaces your existing switch, providing new physical buttons at the wall location in addition to app and voice control. In either case, any pull chains on the fan itself should be left in their highest settings, as speed control will now be handled by the WhiskerSense system.
